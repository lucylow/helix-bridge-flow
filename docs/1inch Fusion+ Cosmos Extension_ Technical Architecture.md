**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This document presents the technical architecture for extending 1inch Fusion+ to enable atomic swaps between Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. The solution implements Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to ensure trustless, bidirectional token swaps while preserving the core hashlock and timelock functionality required for non-EVM implementations.

The architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of cross-chain interoperability by creating a bridge between Ethereum's EVM-based smart contracts and Cosmos' SDK-based blockchain infrastructure. Through careful design of atomic swap protocols, we ensure that either both parties receive their intended tokens or both parties can reclaim their original assets, eliminating counterparty risk.

## System Overview

### Core Components

The Fusion+ Cosmos extension consists of four primary components working in concert to enable seamless cross-chain swaps:

**Ethereum Smart Contracts Layer**: A sophisticated set of Solidity contracts deployed on Ethereum (Sepolia testnet for development) that handle token locking, hashlock verification, timelock management, and atomic claim/refund operations. These contracts extend the existing Fusion+ architecture while maintaining compatibility with the 1inch ecosystem.

**Cosmos SDK Module**: A custom x/atomicswap module built using the Cosmos SDK framework, providing native blockchain-level support for atomic swaps. This module integrates with the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to facilitate cross-chain message passing and token transfers.

**CosmWasm Smart Contracts**: WebAssembly-based smart contracts deployed on Cosmos chains that implement the non-EVM side of the atomic swap protocol. These contracts handle hashlock verification, timelock enforcement, and token custody with full compatibility with Cosmos' native token standards.

**Frontend Interface**: A React-based web application providing an intuitive user interface for initiating and monitoring cross-chain swaps. The frontend integrates with both Ethereum (via ethers.js) and Cosmos (via CosmJS) to provide a unified user experience.

### Atomic Swap Protocol Design

The atomic swap protocol implements a sophisticated two-phase commit mechanism that ensures transaction atomicity across heterogeneous blockchain networks. The protocol leverages cryptographic hashlocks and time-based timelocks to create trustless escrow conditions.

**Phase 1 - Initiation**: The swap initiator locks tokens on the source chain with a cryptographic hashlock derived from a secret value known only to the initiator. The lock includes a timelock that allows the initiator to reclaim funds if the swap is not completed within the specified timeframe.

**Phase 2 - Completion**: The swap recipient claims the locked tokens on the destination chain by revealing the secret that satisfies the hashlock condition. This revelation enables the initiator to claim their corresponding tokens on the source chain, completing the atomic swap.

The protocol ensures that either both parties receive their intended tokens or both can reclaim their original assets, eliminating the possibility of partial completion that could result in loss of funds.

## Detailed Architecture Components

### Ethereum Smart Contract Architecture

The Ethereum component consists of a modular smart contract system designed for extensibility and security. The primary contract, `CrossChainSwap.sol`, serves as the main entry point for all swap operations while delegating specific functionality to specialized contracts.

**CrossChainSwap Contract**: This contract manages the complete lifecycle of atomic swaps originating from or terminating on Ethereum. It implements a state machine that tracks swap progression through distinct phases: Initiated, Locked, Claimed, and Refunded. The contract maintains a mapping of swap identifiers to swap structures containing all relevant metadata including token addresses, amounts, hashlock values, timelock timestamps, and participant addresses.

The contract implements several critical functions for swap management. The `initiateCrossChainSwap` function allows users to lock ERC-20 tokens or Ether with specified hashlock and timelock parameters. The function performs comprehensive validation of input parameters, ensures sufficient token allowances, and emits events for cross-chain monitoring systems.

The `claimSwap` function enables swap completion by accepting the secret that satisfies the hashlock condition. Upon successful verification, the function transfers locked tokens to the designated recipient and updates the swap state to prevent double-spending. The function includes reentrancy protection and comprehensive error handling to ensure secure execution.

The `refundSwap` function provides a safety mechanism for swap initiators to reclaim their tokens after timelock expiration. This function includes strict timelock validation to prevent premature refunds and maintains audit trails for all refund operations.

**Token Management**: The contract system supports both native Ether and ERC-20 token swaps through a unified interface. For ERC-20 tokens, the contract implements the standard approval-based transfer mechanism with additional safety checks for tokens with non-standard implementations. The system includes support for fee-on-transfer tokens and tokens with supply adjustment mechanisms.

**Security Features**: The contract implements multiple layers of security including reentrancy guards, overflow protection, and comprehensive input validation. All external calls are carefully managed to prevent common attack vectors such as reentrancy attacks and front-running exploits.

### Cosmos SDK Module Architecture

The Cosmos component leverages the modular architecture of the Cosmos SDK to implement native blockchain-level support for atomic swaps. The x/atomicswap module provides a comprehensive framework for managing cross-chain swap operations within the Cosmos ecosystem.

**Module Structure**: The module follows standard Cosmos SDK conventions with distinct components for message handling, state management, and query processing. The keeper component manages all state transitions and business logic, while the message server handles user interactions and validation.

**State Management**: The module maintains several key-value stores for tracking swap state, participant information, and timelock schedules. The primary swap store maps unique swap identifiers to comprehensive swap objects containing all relevant metadata. Additional indexes enable efficient querying by participant address, token denomination, and expiration time.

**Message Types**: The module defines several message types for different swap operations. The `MsgCreateAtomicSwap` message initiates new swaps with specified parameters including counterparty information, token amounts, hashlock values, and timelock durations. The `MsgClaimAtomicSwap` message enables swap completion through secret revelation, while `MsgRefundAtomicSwap` provides timelock-based refund functionality.

**IBC Integration**: The module integrates deeply with the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol to enable seamless cross-chain message passing. Custom IBC packet types carry swap-related information between chains, enabling coordinated swap execution across multiple blockchain networks.

**Timelock Management**: The module implements sophisticated timelock management using the Cosmos SDK's block time mechanisms. Automated cleanup processes remove expired swaps and trigger refund operations, ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing state bloat.

### CosmWasm Contract Implementation

The CosmWasm contracts provide WebAssembly-based smart contract functionality for Cosmos chains that support the CosmWasm virtual machine. These contracts implement the core atomic swap logic with full compatibility with Cosmos native tokens and IBC transfers.

**Escrow Contract**: The primary escrow contract manages token custody and implements hashlock/timelock verification logic. The contract maintains internal state for active swaps and provides query interfaces for external monitoring systems.

**Hashlock Verification**: The contract implements SHA-256 based hashlock verification with support for variable-length secrets. The verification process includes comprehensive validation to prevent hash collision attacks and ensures cryptographic security equivalent to the Ethereum implementation.

**Token Handling**: The contract supports both native Cosmos tokens and IBC voucher tokens through the standard bank module interface. Token transfers are executed atomically with swap state updates to ensure consistency and prevent partial execution scenarios.

**IBC Hooks**: The contract implements IBC hooks to enable automatic processing of cross-chain messages. These hooks trigger appropriate contract functions based on incoming IBC packets, enabling seamless integration with the broader cross-chain swap protocol.

## Hashlock and Timelock Implementation

### Cryptographic Hashlock Design

The hashlock mechanism forms the cryptographic foundation of the atomic swap protocol, ensuring that swap completion requires knowledge of a secret value while maintaining privacy until revelation. The implementation uses SHA-256 hashing to create a commitment scheme that is both secure and efficient across different blockchain platforms.

**Secret Generation**: Swap initiators generate cryptographically secure random secrets using platform-appropriate random number generators. The secret length is standardized at 32 bytes to provide sufficient entropy while maintaining compatibility across all supported platforms. The secret generation process includes additional entropy sources to prevent predictable patterns that could compromise security.

**Hash Computation**: The hashlock value is computed as the SHA-256 hash of the secret concatenated with additional metadata including swap identifier and participant addresses. This approach prevents hash reuse attacks and ensures that each swap has a unique hashlock even when using the same secret across multiple swaps.

**Verification Process**: Both Ethereum and Cosmos implementations include identical hashlock verification logic to ensure consistency across platforms. The verification process includes comprehensive validation of input parameters and protection against timing attacks that could reveal information about the secret.

### Timelock Mechanism

The timelock mechanism provides temporal constraints that enable automatic refund functionality while preventing indefinite token locking. The implementation uses absolute timestamps to ensure consistent behavior across different blockchain networks with varying block times.

**Timelock Calculation**: Timelock values are calculated as absolute Unix timestamps rather than block numbers to ensure consistent behavior across chains with different block production rates. The system includes safety margins to account for clock skew and network propagation delays.

**Expiration Handling**: Both platforms implement automated expiration handling that enables refund operations after timelock expiration. The Ethereum implementation uses view functions to check expiration status, while the Cosmos implementation includes automated cleanup processes that trigger refund operations.

**Safety Margins**: The protocol includes configurable safety margins to prevent race conditions between claim and refund operations. These margins account for network congestion, block production variability, and cross-chain message propagation delays.

## Bidirectional Swap Flow

### Ethereum to Cosmos Swap Flow

The Ethereum to Cosmos swap flow demonstrates the protocol's ability to move value from EVM-based chains to Cosmos SDK-based chains while maintaining atomic execution guarantees.

**Step 1 - Initiation on Ethereum**: The swap initiator calls the `initiateCrossChainSwap` function on the Ethereum contract, providing the recipient's Cosmos address, token amount, hashlock, and timelock parameters. The contract validates all parameters, locks the specified tokens, and emits a `SwapInitiated` event containing all relevant swap metadata.

**Step 2 - Cross-Chain Message Relay**: Off-chain relayer services monitor Ethereum events and construct corresponding IBC packets for transmission to the target Cosmos chain. These packets contain all necessary information to create the corresponding swap on the Cosmos side, including hashlock values, timelock parameters, and participant information.

**Step 3 - Cosmos Swap Creation**: Upon receiving the IBC packet, the Cosmos chain processes the message through the x/atomicswap module, creating a corresponding swap with matching parameters. The Cosmos swap includes a longer timelock to ensure the Ethereum swap can be completed even if the Cosmos swap is claimed at the last moment.

**Step 4 - Secret Revelation and Claiming**: The swap recipient reveals the secret on the Cosmos chain to claim their tokens. This revelation is captured in the transaction data and can be extracted by monitoring systems. The secret is then used to claim the original tokens on Ethereum, completing the atomic swap.

**Step 5 - Completion and Cleanup**: Both chains update their respective swap states to reflect completion. Monitoring systems verify successful completion and trigger any necessary cleanup operations to maintain system efficiency.

### Cosmos to Ethereum Swap Flow

The reverse flow enables value transfer from Cosmos chains to Ethereum while maintaining the same atomic execution guarantees and security properties.

**Step 1 - Initiation on Cosmos**: The swap initiator submits a `MsgCreateAtomicSwap` message to the Cosmos chain, specifying the Ethereum recipient address, token amount, hashlock, and timelock parameters. The chain validates the message, locks the specified tokens, and updates the swap state.

**Step 2 - IBC Message Transmission**: The Cosmos chain constructs an IBC packet containing the swap information and transmits it to connected relayer networks. These relayers monitor for such packets and construct corresponding Ethereum transactions.

**Step 3 - Ethereum Contract Interaction**: Relayer services call the Ethereum contract's `createCounterSwap` function, providing the swap parameters received from Cosmos. The Ethereum contract creates a corresponding swap with appropriate timelock adjustments.

**Step 4 - Secret Revelation on Ethereum**: The swap recipient reveals the secret on Ethereum to claim their tokens. The secret revelation is captured in the transaction logs and propagated back to the Cosmos chain through monitoring systems.

**Step 5 - Cosmos Claim Completion**: Using the revealed secret, the original swap initiator claims their tokens on the Cosmos chain, completing the bidirectional atomic swap.

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security

The protocol implements multiple layers of cryptographic security to protect against various attack vectors. The hashlock mechanism uses SHA-256, which provides 256 bits of security and is resistant to known cryptographic attacks. Secret generation includes multiple entropy sources to prevent predictable patterns.

**Hash Collision Resistance**: The use of SHA-256 provides strong collision resistance, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to find alternative secrets that produce the same hash value. This property is essential for maintaining the integrity of the atomic swap protocol.

**Preimage Resistance**: The one-way nature of SHA-256 ensures that revealing the hashlock does not compromise the secret until the swap recipient chooses to reveal it. This property maintains privacy and prevents premature secret disclosure.

**Secret Uniqueness**: The protocol includes mechanisms to ensure secret uniqueness across swaps, preventing replay attacks and hash reuse scenarios that could compromise security.

### Economic Security
